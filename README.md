# Transparent assessment of spatial and/or temporal prediction methods

This repository aims at making spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal prediction methods more transparent and comparable. 
To this end it contains 
- **[datasets](datasets/README.md)** that can be used to assess the performance of prediction methods.
- **[prediction methods](methods/README.md)** in the form of executable scripts. The scripts illustrate how to apply the prediction methods to the datasets. 
- :exclamation:not yet implemented:exclamation: **comparison** of the performance of all prediction methods for each dataset.   

## datasets
- [MOD13A1_NDVI_Alaska](datasets/MOD13A1_NDVI_Alaska/README.md): MODIS NDVI data
- more to come...

## methods
- [gapfill](methods/gapfill/README.md): an R package to predict missing values in spatio-temporal remote sensing data
- more to come...
